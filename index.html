      About me: Hi, I'm Johann.  I've lived just off Dutch Village Road
      for 15 years, and I've been running for half that time.  When my dad
      turned 70, he decided to start running; he got me hooked at age 40.
      I've run with our sister & brother groups,
      the <a href="http://northendrunners.com" target="_new">North End Runners</a>
      and the <a href="http://bltrunners.com" target="_new">BLT Runners</a>,
      as well as <a href="https://www.parkrun.ca/chainoflakes/" target="_new">parkrun</a>,
      and I love all of them.  Today Fairview has lots of runners,
      and more who might fall in love with running.
      So let's get together for fun runs and socializing!
