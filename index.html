      About me: Hi, I'm Johann.  I've lived just off Dutch Village Road
      since 2009, and I've been running since 2016.  When my dad turned 70,
      he decided to start running.  He got me hooked at age 40.  <br/>

      I've run with our sister & brother groups, the
      <a href="http://northendrunners.com" target="_new">North End Runners</a>
      and the
      <a href="http://bltrunners.com" target="_new">BLT Runners</a>,
      as well as at the wonderful
      <a href="https://www.parkrun.ca/chainoflakes/" target="_new">parkrun</a>,
      and I love all of them.  <br/>

      Today Fairview has lots of runners, and more who might fall in love
      with running when they try it.  So let's get together for fun runs
      and socializing!
